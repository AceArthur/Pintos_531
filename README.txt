   This project implements the ability to allow programs to interact with Operating System using System Calls.
   The project handles running user programs out of System kernel allowing more than one process to run at a time
   and implements various required functionalities such as argument parsing, system calls, file system access etc.
   
   
1. DESIGN DOCUMENT
   The Design Document (DESIGNDOC) can be found in src/userprog/ directory.
   A copy of the output of "make grade" (grade) is also included in the root folder for reference. 

2. COMPILATION AND EXECUTION
   The project can be compiled simply by typing "make" in the src/userprog directory. 
   executing "make check" in src/userprog/build directory executes all the tests associated with Project 2.
   Similarly, "make grade" scores the code based on all the tests associated with Project 2.
